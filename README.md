# Giphy

This app will link a webpage to the Giphy API producing a search that will call 10 gifs from the corresponding button that is clicked.

If a user would like to add a button to the button section of the website, they can type it into the "gif-search" input field, which will produce a new button allowing for the user to then search the Giphy API using that term.

The title and rating of each gif will be displayed under the corresponding gif.
